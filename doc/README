This directory can be builds into a web site using Jekyll
(https://jekyllrb.com/).

Viewing the site locally:

$ jekyll serve --port 8989 --watch

(open http://localhost:8989)

Deploying the site to Github pages:

The script "deploy" will do the following:

1) Clone the repository into a temp directory and check out the
gh-pages branch.

2) Remove all the files from git and copy this directory into the project.

3) Add all the files to git, commit the changes and push to Github.

This has the odd effect that all the files are freshly created in git
each time you deploy, but it works around the problem that Github
project web sites use a separate branch for the site content instead
of a directory.
