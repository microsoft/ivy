IVy is a research tool intended to allow interactive development of
protocols and their proofs of correctness and to provide a platform
for developing and experimenting with automated proof techniques. In
particular, IVy provides interactive visualization of automated
proofs, and supports a use model in which the human protocol designer
and the automated tool interact to expose errors and prove
correctness.
